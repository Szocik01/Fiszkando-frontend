<h3>Fiszkando</h3></br>
<h2>Description</h2> </br>
<p>Fiszkando is a platform created by Wiktor Szot, Mateusz Gorczowski and Artur Åšcibor for students who want to prepare to their exams in more pleasant and efficient way. The idea is that admins and mods prepare every possible question they can from presentations which students need to prepare for exams. Then they put questions on platfrom in the form of multiple or single choice tests and question base. The questions are divided between courses eg. "Podstawy programowania". The courses are also divided between different universities. Because of that students can choose university and courses that they need in their current academic term. To get access to questions they need to by course they are interested in. The payment must be done once to gain eternal access to certain course. The student can buy as many courses as they desire. The value of certain course would depend on amount of work admins and mods give to create it. The aplication is dynamically getting its content from server. The app also has the admin panel to dynamically add, remove and modify all courses, universities and questions, and to remove or give mod permissions to the users. </p> <br/>
<h2>Encountered problem</h2></br>
<p>We wanted to make this project commercial but we encountered a problem. To create this app the way we intended we would need to ask every single professor if we can use his presentation to make profit out of it. At the beginning it wouldn't be a problem since we would create courses only from our IT institute. But if app would grow bigger it would become impossible to ask everyone, especially that they can simply not agree or demand some money for it. Also it would require to sign some contracts that we can use their work. It's too many problems for young students. But we do not give up this project. We intend to return to this project one day to develop it further and deploy Fiszkando for commercial usage.</p> <br/>
